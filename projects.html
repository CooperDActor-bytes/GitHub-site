<p>Unfortunately when you work for a company writing code you can't make that public (except in some cases).
  Most of the development work I did at Harvest was internal, workflow-type work.  Although I can't post the code
  here, I've created a description of a number of the projects that I worked on, and what they accomplished.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Customer Support</h3>

<a href=""><h4>Support Stats</h4></a>
<p>The Support Stats project was the first "side project" I worked on during my time at Harvest. The code I wrote
  for it has since been replaced, but the original idea/metrics live on in a new iteration.</p>

<a href=""><h4>Workflow hacks, notifiers</h4></a>

<p>I developed a series of shell scripts, and pieces of code that tied in to the Zendesk API to help notify us of new
  support tickets. I spoke about a number of these hacks in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC6VPcvrpCs">Userconf</a>
  talk that I gave on reducing customer response times.</p>

<h3>Quality Assurance</h3>

<a href=""><h4>QA Stats</h4></a>
<p>Similar in concept to Support Stats, I was looking for a way to quantify some of the areas we worked on in QA.
  This project was interesting because it tapped into a number of different APIs from a number of different products.</p>

<a href=""><h4>Smoke Test Suite</h4></a>

<p>The Smoke Test Suite was the first set of automated tests I wrote in QA. The goal of this suite was to identify the
  critical parts of our applications and run a series of automated tests on those areas each time the application was
  deployed. This suite had to integrate with our existing CI workflow, it had to execute quickly and it had to notify
  us (through Slack) in the event of a failure.</p>

<a href=""><h4>Android Build Pipeline</h4></a>

<p>The Harvest Android app is automatically built in a CI environment every time the master branch is updated. An
  artifact .apk file is produced in this process. We wanted to be able to run some automated tests against this file to
  ensure that no regressions had been introduced. In order to do so, I wrote a connector, in Ruby, that received a webhook
  from the Android build, translated the JSON received into the format needed, fetched the .apk from the latest build and
  transferred it to the automated testing process.</p>

<a href=""><h4>Android Automated Tests</h4></a>

<p>Written in Appium/Ruby, this test suite runs against every new Android build. It receives the output from the "translator"
  piece, and kicks off a new set of tests executing in parallel in a continuous integration environment. The tests themselves
  are run on virtual devices hosted by Sauce Labs. Failures are posted to Slack.</p>

<a href=""><h4>Automated regression suite</h4></a>

<p>This is a completely selfish project. I wanted a toolkit that would help me to test across all of Harvest's apps to do a
  quick check for any regressions that might have been introduced. This suite is designed to be run locally, in parallel
  against Harvest's staging environment. I even built in support for Harvest's test case management software, so that results
  from an automated test run would pass/fail test cases automatically.</p>

<a href=""><h4>Automated Integrations Checker</h4></a>

<p>Harvest maintains <a href="https://getharvest.com/integrations/">a directory of integrations</a> on it's public web site.
  As this list grew, it became increasingly difficult to keep track whether an integration had moved (so the page we were linking
  to produced a 404) or whether the integration disappeared altogether. This started as a Hack Week project, and in that time I
  developed a proof of concept.  After Hack Week, I enhanced it and added in Slack notifications when integrations change.</p>

<a href=""><h4>Wordpress automations</h4></a>

<p>Coming to Harvest, I had a fair amount of experience working with <a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> so I gradually
  took over maintenance of the Harvest blog. I wrote some automations that tie into the deploy process for the Harvest blog and
  automatically perform various upgrade actions and checks.</p>

<h3>Open Source</h3>

<a href="https://github.com/morvader/ExploratoryTestingChromeExtension"><h4>Exploratory Testing Chrome Extension</h4></a>

<p>Contributed a major UI overhaul to the Exploratory Testing Chrome Extension written by Francisco Moreno. Plenty of ideas
  for future enhancements!</p>
