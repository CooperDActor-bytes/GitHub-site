Iâ€™m a Software Engineer with full-stack experience but currently focused on the front-end. With over 5 years of experience developing software with high standards and an interest in using empathy as a tool for creating functional and beautiful products. I  really enjoys writing optimised code and well-structured web applications using modern JavaScript tools that are performant while offering a wonderful user experience. Also I am also constantly improving my knowledge of  computer science fundamentals.
