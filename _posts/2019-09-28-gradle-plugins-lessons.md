Hello! For a long time I wanted to migrate my [Bookcrossing Mobile](https://github.com/fobo66/BookcrossingMobile) app to Gradle Kotlin DSL.
But I've used remote Groovy function for loading API keys from `.properties` files. Here is a [gist](https://gist.github.com/fobo66/17d5116b5c7bccf5f28036f401f3c09d).
Despite it's a simple function, I didn't wanted to write this for each of my projects, thus this gist was created.
