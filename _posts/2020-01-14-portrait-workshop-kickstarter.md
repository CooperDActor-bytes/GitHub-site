A lot of my free time and energy has been put into developing Portrait Workshop with with the Worldspinner team,
and we have [launched a kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/worldspinner/portrait-workshop/)
that will help us bring it to market.
Check it out if you are looking for a great tool to build characters for games, stories, or online avatars!
Here are some examples:
