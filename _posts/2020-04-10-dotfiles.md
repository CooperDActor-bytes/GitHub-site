I recently created a [personal dotfiles repository](https://github.com/axis7818/dotfiles) to store my personalized
configurations and settings for the tools I use. I put a lot of effort into customizing my
development tools and I have received a lot of compliments on my terminal, VSCode setup, and vim configuration.

Here are some previews of what I look at while I write code.

## ZSH Theme

I built this ZSH Theme from scratch. It took a while to strike a balance between useful information and
spacious layout without taking up too much space in the terminal. This theme shows the current user,
current directory (collapsed), git repo information, and the active python virtual environment.
The prompt line lives under that information to make it easier to use a narrower window without dealing
with word wrap. It also shows failed exit codes and injects an extra newline between commands to visually
separate two REPL loops.

## NeoVim Configuration

I recently got the bright idea to attempt to use vim as my primary text editor. VSCode felt
like it was slowly getting bit bulky and sluggish when working on a large project with a lot
of extensions. I decided to build an IDE-like experience in myself using vim and tmux, but haven't been able
to get it to the point where it is as useful as VSCode. I may revisit this in the future!

Some notable plugins:

- **[NERDTree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree)** for file navigation
- **[vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)** for a better status bar
- **[coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim)** for autocompletion and other "smart" features
- **[ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim)** to easily open specific files

## VSCode Setup

VSCode has been my primary editor for years. I love its flexibility for working on projects in a
variety of languages and technologies. It also has a very good vim plugin (I can't write code
without vim navigation). Over time, my VSCode setup has become highly customized.
