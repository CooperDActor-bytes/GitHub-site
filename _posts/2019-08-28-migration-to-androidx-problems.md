Hello! Recently I decided to get back to my old project, [Bookcrossing Mobile](https://github.com/fobo66/BookcrossingMobile) app,
to update it to the recent SDK versions and try out new things and approaches in Android development. Luckily, it was fine now,
migration went smoothly, much better than at first attempt year ago.

However, there were some important points that I've discovered during migration, and I believe these point can simplify developer's life in
the future. Hope that they will be useful for you.
