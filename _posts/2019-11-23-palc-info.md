# Why am I not updating palc?

Well, there is a big bug that I am too busy to figure out. I suppose I could just delete the feature, but then I wouldn't have that feature!

I cant remember what the bug is but there is an error in compilation -- so you can't just skip the error by using `try` and `except`.

If anyone can help; that would be great!

Sincerely, 

Ynohtna
