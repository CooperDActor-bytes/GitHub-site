Hi devs and other awesome people,
I always want to make people's life easier, that's the original idea behind [Interclip](/what-is-interclip/). But going to a URL is lame AF, so I created a desktop application [Interclip Desktop](https://github.com/aperta-principium/Interclip-desktop). It was built using Electron and Node.js. 
You can try it out yourself if you want! Just choose your platform and click the link. (It might say it's not trustworthy or whatever, but I just didn't want to do all the certificate stuff. Sorry in advance. But yes, you can trust it. Why? It's open-source and you can check out the whole code!)

[Download on your platform automagically](http://unidev.hys.cz/desktop)

[Download manually from the GitHub release page](https://github.com/aperta-principium/Interclip-desktop/releases)
