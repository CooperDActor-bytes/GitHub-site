title: "Getting Started"

Just made this thing to improve my understanding of creating web pages, ruby, gems, gitub api, free web hosting.
So far im pretty excited about the customisations i have planned but it will take time to implement them as ill have to learn how to introduce them.
But im more than satisfied with todays work, never thought hosting it could be so easy.
