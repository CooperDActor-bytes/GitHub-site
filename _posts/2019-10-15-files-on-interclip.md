# 🔖 A new release of Interclip is here!
Here is a brief summary of what it has to offer:
* 🐛 Fixed a bug with embedding files with uppercase file extensions 
* ✨ Made a function which automatically redirects you to the desired URL of a code
* ✨ Added a smart menu, which houses the list of all pages and updates on a page-basis
* ✨ Added the ability to upload files using [put.re](https://put.re/)
* ✨ Added embedding also to the [new clip](https://github.com/aperta-principium/Interclip/blob/master/new.php) section
* ♻️ Redid the whole embed script
* Moved the whole embedding process to [aperta-principium/Embed](https://github.com/aperta-principium/Embed)
* Checked if the argument passed to api.php is an URL
