<p>The Support Stats project was the first project I worked on with Harvest, while working in customer support. As a side project,
  I developed a system which pulled data from the <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/">Zendesk API</a>, cached it locally, and performed some basic statistical transformations
  with the data.</p>

<p>Prior to starting in customer support, Harvest wasn't tracking any metrics around support. We had no data on ticket volume, response
  times, number of interactions to resolution or customer satisfaction. </p>

<p>This data became one of the foundational components used in making decisions in support: it helped us identify when ticket volumes were
  highest, extrapolate to when we would need to add to our support team, and to keep an eye on the quality of support that our customers
  received.</p>

<p>This project has undergone some changes over the past 8 years, but a version is still in use by the support team today.</p>
