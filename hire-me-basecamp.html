<h1 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Hi Basecamp!</h1>

<p>I'm Jon. I've met a few of you before over the years (hey Chase, how's it going?) at conferences and such. I'm a father of three who lives out
   on the West Coast of Canada. I grew up on the prairies, but decided that winters with rain are far more fun than shovelling
   snow in freezing temperatures. Oceans and mountains are definitely my natural habitat.</p>

<p><img src="http://intrc.tv/2f0756ad2ca7/IMG_0043.jpg" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px; max-width: 300px; border: 2px solid #999;" /> When I'm not at my computer, I love spending time outside with my year-old Boxer (Baxter), hiking, swimming and checking out new places around
  the islands. I picked up 3D printing as a hobby a few years ago, and tinkering with that fills my time on rainy days.</p>

<p>Looking toward the future, I like roles that mix technology and people the most. I love interacting with customers and co-workers,
   collaborating to fix problems and answer questions. I also really enjoy digging in to code; writing something to speed up a process or
   automate something that's repetitive. When I find a balance between those two worlds, I'm happiest.</p>

<p>Basecamp is a piece of software that I really like using. It's changed a lot over the years, but it's always felt
  like it kept the focus on solving the problems of people that use it. It's a product I believe in. Basecamp (the company and people) have shaped
  my professional life in a lot of ways. From the early days when I was freelancing and <em>Defensive Design for the Web</em> was
  very influential in my practice, to later on reading <em>Getting Real</em> and <em>Remote</em> and coming to realize that maybe that dream of
  living in a beautiful rural setting, and still producing work that's important to people isn't a complete dream.</p>

<h4>You asked about great customer service?</h4>

<p>I spent a few years waiting tables and working in the hospitality industry. As a result, I feel like I'm both far more critical but also far more
  accepting of good and bad service when I'm dining out. I think I drive my girlfriend nuts because I'm constantly critiquing and offering suggestions
  on how things could be improved when we're out. She still puts up with me though.</p>

<p>There was one instance, a couple of months ago, when we went out to dinner and our server was on point. I really couldn't offer any suggestions for
  improvement in the service they provided. What made it so great was that they were so proactive: they paid attention to what was happening at our table
  and timed every interaction perfectly. We sat down and were immediately brought menus and water (there's a great response time!). We were left alone to
  take a first look at the menu, and then they returned at the perfect moment to tell us about specials and take our drink order. There wasn't any exhaustive
  wait times, and they didn't barge in on our conversation when we were in the middle of it. They were friendly, but knowledgeable -- they could answer any
  questions we had about the menu.</p>

<h4>What about learning new skills?</h4>

<p>Not so recently, I was asked to take on QA at Harvest. One of the big parts of that was setting up some automated testing for our various apps.  That
   was a huge learning curve for me as I took on teaching myself a number of testing frameworks (Appium and Selenium) as well as Ruby which I used for
   writing the tests themselves. I had some experience prior to this with things like HTML, CSS and Javascript but tying all of these moving pieces together
   and making it all run seamlessly and automatically was a neat experience.</p>

<p>In this case, automated testing ended up being my "gateway drug" to Ruby. I have since written a number of small applicaitons that serve a specific
   purpose internally. There's a description of those on my <a href="/projects/">projects</a> page. It's been a great tool to add to my toolbelt and it's
   really empowered me to dig deeper into the inner workings of things.</p>

<h4>All this reading, you must be hungry.</h4>

<p>My signature meal, the one that gets my best friend to hop on a ferry and ride an hour to come see me, is New York-style pizza.</p>

<p>I realize that I'm taking a risk here, what with Basecamp being based out of Chicago, but there's something magical about a perfectly cooked thin
  crust pizza: one where the individual ingredients can shine all on their own. Pick any toppings you like, as long as the crust is on point, you'll
  have a fantastic dish. I've experimented with some gluten free options here, and you can get okay results using a gluten free baking mix, but in order
   to truly nail this recipe, you'll have to embrace the gluten-y goodness.</p>

<h5>Making the perfect pizza crust at home</h5>

<p>I've made the distinction "at home" here, because as much as I'd like it, I just don't have an oven capable of producting temperatures of 700 to 900
   degrees (like a comercial pizza oven).  My oven maxes out at 500 degrees. That's good enough for our needs though. You will need one piece of specialized gear for this: you're going
   to need a <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Unicook-Ceramic-Grilling-Resistant-Rectangle/dp/B06XGV3RS4/">baking stone/pizza stone</a>. Go ahead and put that
   in your oven and turn it up to the highest temperature you can get before we get started.</p>

<p>The ingredient list:</p>

  <ul style="padding: 10px 0 10px 45px;">
    <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ cup semolina (optional, but gives you a little extra texture)</li>
    <li>1 cup warm water</li>
    <li>2 tsp. active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 tbsp. sugar</li>
    <li>1 tbsp. salt</li>
  </ul>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Mix the water, yeast and sugar together in a bowl and let the mixture sit. After a few minutes, it should start to get frothy/bubbly (indicating that the yeast is good).</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Measure the all-purpose flour and semolina flour into a mixing bowl. I'm lazy, so for me it goes into the bowl on my stand mixer and I attach the dough hook attachment. Add the salt (yes, a full tablespoon!)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Start the mixer on low and start to slowly add the frothy yeast mixture from step 1.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once you've added all of your water, turn the speed up on the mixer a notch. Keep an eye on your dough and when it just starts to come together/not look completely dried out, stop the mixer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Sprinkle some flour on your counter/table/cutting board and turn the dough out on to the floured surface. Continue to work the dough by hand until it's elastic-y and stretches well.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Divide your dough up. I'll usually divide this amount into 4 and make 4 smaller pizzas because that's easier to work with. You can go bigger if you want!</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Let your dough rise for a half hour or so.  It should roughly double in size.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Flour up a cutting board and turn one of your portions out. You can use a rolling pin if you like, but it's also just fine to work it with you hands until it's the right shape/size and thickness. I try for roundish and a 10" diameter.</p>
